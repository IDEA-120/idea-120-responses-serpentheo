Murray's predictions about the future of technology were shockingly accurate. Many of the things she cited, including "Web TV's" (laptops), digital archives of practically anything, etc. have all become extremely relevant in daily life. Later in her paper, she states, "Perhaps the first steps in this direction will be in the form of immersive visits to pleasurably explorable 3-D dreamscapes." She then goes on to explain how the realism within video games have almost tricked people into believing they were actually there. I think this applies to how The Mandalorian created their sets. Many believe that The Mandalorian has some of the most photorealistic sets to ever exist, and this is thanks to the hyper-realistic videogaming software that created these sets. The viewer feels as if they and the actor are full immersed into the fictional land before them because its strinkingly realistic.
