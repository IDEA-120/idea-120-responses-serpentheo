While I do agree with Bridle that there are issues regarding the content that children can access, I don't necessarily believe its much different than the internet I grew up with, its just a matter of how it is handled. I grew up around the time YouTube started to really become popular. I was always glued to various videos, and some of the creators on Youtube practically raised me. I had a lot of good experiences with the internet as a child. However, I also had quite a few traumatic experiences that still affect me to this day. I don't blame the internet for those experiences; I blame the people who were supposed to be there to protect me as a child.

Bridle states that the only true fix he can see when it comes to changing what children are exposed to on the internet is completely shutting the platforms down. While that would fix the issue of what children can and can't see, it would deprive all of us of a huge library of information that is right at our fingertips. I do wish he had suggested a better alternative, but I personally can't think of one cure-all that wouldn't include limiting what everyone, not just children, see. For now, I think parents need to continue to monitor their children's internet usage very closely. That is, if they allow their children any internet usage at all up to a certain age. Until there is a better way of moderating websites like YouTube and Google, it will continue to be the parent's responsibility to very closely monitor their children.
